SublimeMessages
===============

A manager for messages that belong to a line of code in Sublime Text. This plugin handles creating gutter marks for lines with messages, and changing the status bar to relay the message when the cursor changes lines. This plugin depends on other Message\* plugins to work. The idea being MessagesPylint will generate python lint messages, and tell this plugin about them.
